            <div class="boxed">
                <p>Activities include but are not limited to: guided horse-riding tours amongst the mountain trails, traditional Dutch oven cooking, archery, clay pigeon shooting, western artillery displays, plant identification nature walks, star gazing, fishing, hiking and swimming.  With several locations, the pain of planning a vacation just got easier. No matter your age, there is fun for everyone who visits. With cabins or tents, you get to pick the authenticity of your experience. Prices vary, meaning you only pay for what you do and will never be overcharged. We believe everyone should be able to experience the great outdoors as it is. You will be provided with breakfast lunch and dinner for each day of your stay. And even better, you will get to learn how to cook the food and learn techniques of mountain men for years ago. 
                Package 1: A cabin that sleeps 5 people and one restroom. You pick the duration or length of stay. Select from list of activities to add to your iterinary.

                We’re open all year round. To get the best experience, we have opted to keep the doors open every season. This provides a taste of how ranchers and cowboys alike live all year, every year. Of course, weather means a difference in activities provided, but the authenticity will be real nonetheless. Activities include but are not limited to: guided horse-riding tours amongst the mountain trails, traditional Dutch oven cooking, archery, clay pigeon shooting, western artillery displays, plant identification nature walks, star gazing, fishing, hiking and swimming.

With cabins or tents, you get to pick the authenticity of your experience.
                Package 2: Choose the amount of tents you need, each tent sleeps 2 people. When choosing this package, the restrooms and showers will be located in a building in the middle of the ranch, similar to a camp ground. Just like package 1, pick your activities and you'll be charged according to that.
